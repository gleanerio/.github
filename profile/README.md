# About

Gleaner is a tool for extracting JSON-LD from web pages. You provide Gleaner a list of sites to index and it will access and retrieve pages based on the sitemap.xml of the domain(s). Gleaner can then check for well formed and valid structure in documents and process the JSON-LD data graphs into a form usable to drive a search interface.
